# Pytorch YoloV2 implementation from scratch


This repository is simple implementation of `YOLOv2 algorithm` for better understanding and use it for more **object detection** usage. This project based on Pytorch. The code of project is so easy and clear.

## Dataset

Pretrained weights in this implemetation are based on training yolo team on COCO trainval dataset

## Usage

**You can have your own object detection machine**

**Note**: The tests of this repo run with `cpu` mode so if you use `gpu` prediction become much faster

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miladlink/YoloV2.git

cd YoloV2
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Pretrained Weights

* Download used weights in this project from [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov2.weights) or go to weights and click to yolov2.weights

**or**

```bash
chmod +x weights/get_weights.sh
weights/get_weights.sh
```

### Help

```bash
python detect.py -h
```

### Detection

```bash
python detect.py -w path/to/weights\
-ct <conf_thresh>\
-nt <nms_thresh>\
-p path/to/img\
-s
```
